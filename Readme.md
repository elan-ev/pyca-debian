# Debian Packaging for pyCA

## Build the package

To build this package you will need a machine (a Docker container should also be sufficient) with [Debian Buster](https://www.debian.org/) with `build-essential` and `devscripts` installed.

To create the package run the `build.sh` from within this directory.

If you would like to look in the process in more details, take a look into the script or visit the [Debian New Maintainers' Guide](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/) as a complete source about packaging for Debian.
